# Birdwatch Data Collection

This repo includes code used in my thesis, Crowdsourcing Disinformation: Evaluating the Effects of the Twitter Community Notes Program (working title, 2023). 

birdwatch_tweets.R collects data on the number of likes and comments on Tweets that are identified in the public release data of Community Notes.
