# Birdwatch Data Collection

This repo includes code used in my thesis, Crowdsourcing Disinformation: Evaluating the Effects of the Twitter Community Notes Program (working title, 2023). 

birdwatch_tweets.R collects data on the number of likes and comments on Tweets that are identified in the public release data of Community Notes. It has breaks automatically built in to avoid sending too many requests at once, per Twitter API v2.0. 

If you use any of the files in this repo, please give me a head's up/citation! (actually, might not matter if Elon Musk shuts down Twitter API anyway).
